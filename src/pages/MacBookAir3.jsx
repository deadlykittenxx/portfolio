        We created a system which functions with a SmartTicket that the user can carry around and use with the Interactive Maps. The goal is to provide clear and accurate information and directions to novices with little to no experience with railway systems and intermediates which are not familiar with the city. <br />
        Some of the key issues which we were looking to solve were internet-dependent navigation, visual disabilities and inaccurate information sourcing.
